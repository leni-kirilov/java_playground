    //Write a program to find if the permutation of a string (given) is a palindrome or not.
    //For an array of integers and unique values, write a program code to decipher if the sum of any two integers in the array is equal to a given value.
    //For a given two-dimensional array with integers of unique values, write a program to make the entire column or row of the array zero if any element in the array is zero.
    //You are given two linked lists. Each of the linked lists has an integer value. Write a program to add the two linked lists and return the value of their sum.

    //TREE
    //You’re given the root of a binary tree. Write a code to show the node values at every level.
    //For a given binary search tree where two nodes of the tree are swapped, write a program to correct the binary search tree.
    //Write a program to check if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.
    //Write an error-free program to check if a given binary tree is balanced or not.

    //Write a phone number word decoder. Write a Java program that will accept a contact number with letters and convert it to a contact number with digits only.
    //Write a Java program that returns an MD5 hash.
    //Print all permutations of String in both iterative and Recursive ways.
    //Given an array of size N, sort the array elements by completing functions heapify() and buildHeap() to implement Heap Sort.

    //Create Morse code translator. Take in a string with alphanumeric characters in lower or upper case. The string can also contain any special characters handled in Morse code. The function should return the Morse code equivalent for the string.

    //Improve search results by enabling users to see relevant search results without being hindered by typos. This will be called the “Group Similar Titles" feature.
    //Given an array of integers and a value, you have to determine whether there are any three integers in the array whose sum equals the given value.
    //Given the head nodes of two linked lists that may or may not intersect, you have to determine if they intersect and return the point of intersection. Else return null.
    //Convert binary tree into a doubly-linked list.
    //Print all braces combinations for a given value n, so they are balanced.
    //Serialize a binary tree to file and deserialize it back to a tree.
    //Search for a given number in a sorted rotated array by some arbitrary number. Return -1 if the number does not exist. Assumption- the array does not contain duplicates.
